## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Organizations face major challenges in ESG and GHG reporting because data is fragmented across departments, suppliers, and systems. Manual collection is slow, error-prone, and difficult to audit. Leadership often lacks a reliable source of truth for emissions performance, scenario analysis, and transition planning.

### 1.2 Product Vision
Build a centralized, assurance-ready digital platform that collects, validates, calculates, analyzes, and reports ESG and GHG data across the enterprise.

### 1.3 Product Goal
Provide a scalable platform to measure Scope 1, Scope 2, and material Scope 3 emissions while improving governance, traceability, and reporting quality.

1. Establish a standardized enterprise-wide GHG measurement system.
2. Centralize ESG and activity data into a single source of truth.
3. Support Scope 3 supplier engagement and prioritization.
4. Enable climate governance and board-level visibility.
5. Generate assurance-ready sustainability reports with audit trails.

### Business Outcomes
- Reduce manual ESG data collection effort

- An immediate focus will be placed on injecting and processing a massive Scope 3 dataset during setup.
- Each record should store source, owner, timestamp, and evidence links.

### 5.4 Emissions Calculation
- The platform must calculate:
  - Scope 1 emissions
  - Scope 2 emissions
  - selected Scope 3 emissions
- Calculations must use configurable emission factors.
- The system must show formula breakdown and calculation traceability.

  - validated
  - rejected
- The system should score supplier data quality.

### 5.6 Validation and Audit Trail
- The platform must validate mandatory fields and input ranges.
- Invalid records must be flagged for review.
- Every update must be versioned.
- The system must maintain a complete audit trail of:
  - record creation
  - updates
